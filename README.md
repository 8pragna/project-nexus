This repository contains the project 1 with basic login and sing in page 
Two HTML pages (login.html and signup.html) are provided, each containing a form for either logging in or signing up.
Both pages link to an external stylesheet (styles.css) and JavaScript file (script.js).
The login page includes input fields for username and password.
The signup page includes input fields for username, email, and password.
The stylesheet resets default browser styles and sets a background image for the entire document.
It defines styles for the container element to create a visually appealing card-like appearance.
Form elements such as headings, input fields, and buttons are styled for consistency and readability.
Hover effects are implemented for buttons to enhance user interaction.
The JavaScript file contains form validation logic primarily focused on the signup form.
It prevents form submission if input fields are empty or invalid.
Error messages are dynamically displayed below the respective input fields to provide real-time feedback.
Email format validation is implemented using a regular expression.
The signup form submits only when all validation criteria are met, ensuring data integrity.
